			<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>The Coca-Cola Company and its affiliates (also collectively referred to as “we”. “our” and “us”)  are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through activities that link to this Privacy Policy including websites (our “Websites”) and any mobile sites, applications, widgets, and other mobile interactive features (collectively, our “Apps”), through other services that we may offer in connections with our Websites and Apps, such as rewards programs, through our official social media pages that we control (our “Social Media Pages”), as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you (collectively, including the Social Media Pages, Apps and Websites, the “Sites”).  By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

<h1>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1><br>

<h3>Personal Information We May Collect</h3><br>

“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual, such as:
<br>
Name
User name
Postal address (including billing and shipping addresses)
Telephone number (including home and mobile phone numbers)
Email address
Credit and debit card number
Profile picture
Social media account ID
Country of residence
In some cases, we may use a third party payment service to process purchases and/or collect donations made through the Sites.  In these cases, your Personal Information may be collected by this third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s use or disclosure of your Personal Information.
<br>
If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<h3>How We May Collect Personal Information</h3>
<br>
We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including: 
<br>
<h4>Through the Sites:</h4>  We may collect Personal Information through the Sites, e.g., when you sign up for a newsletter or make a purchase.
<h4>Offline:</h4>  We may collect Personal Information from you offline, such as when you contact customer service. <br>
<h4>Online tracking:</h4> Because we do not track our Site users over time and across third- party websites, we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.
From Other Sources:  We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.  For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. <br>
<h4>Mobile usage:</h4>  If we are able to identify you as a user of a mobile app, we may, for example, link your activity with Coca-Cola  brands  to one of Coca-Cola's mobile applications. If you have downloaded one or more of our mobile applications, you can opt in to location sharing for additional application capabilities. For example, geo-location will use your device’s latitude and longitude or your device’s location capabilities (e.g. GPS or Wi-Fi) to let you receive information and offers. Or, in-store location through the use of your phone’s Bluetooth signal, LED light chip technologies, or other technologies will permit us to find nearby products for you, get you real-time offers, and more. To learn how to opt out of sharing your location with us, go to the Choices and Access section of this privacy policy.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Personal Information you provide through the Sites may be combined with Personal Information and Other Information that you provide to us (via online or offline means), that is publicly available, or that we may otherwise obtain online or offline, including, for example, from providers of demographic and other information, social media platforms and other third parties.
<br>
<h3>How We May Use Personal Information</h3>

<br>
to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you newsletters or to respond to your questions and comments.<br>

<h3>How Personal Information May Be Disclosed</h3><br>

<h4>To the extent permitted by applicable law, your Personal Information may be disclosed:</h4>

to our third-party strategic partners with whom we may enter into a special relationship.  We will provide you with choices regarding this sharing prior to sharing your Personal Information with a particular strategic partner. Because these third parties will use your Personal Information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their websites for information regarding their privacy practices.<br>
In connection with promotions, for example, to third parties that are sponsors of sweepstakes, instant win promotions, contests and other promotions, to provide lists of the names and countries of residence of winners and/or to announce the names of visitors on the Sites (e.g., on our blog) or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to the applicable promotion.    To the extent that the terms and conditions of the rules concerning the treatment of your Personal Information conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of the rules shall control.<br>
to identify you to anyone to whom you send messages through the Sites.<br>
by you, on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including our Social Media Pages).  Please note that any information you post or disclose through these services will become public information, and may be available to visitors to the Sites and to the general public.  We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, on the Sites.<br>
if you participate in social sharing (such as if you connect your social media account to your Site account or log-into your Site account from your social media account), to your friends associated with your social media account, to other users of the Sites and to your social media account provider, in connection with your social sharing activity.  For example, if you register on the Sites using a social media account, we may post a generic registration message on your social media profile, and if you click a social media “like” button on a Site while logged in to your social media account, your actions will be transmitted to the applicable social media provider and may be available on your social media profile.  By connecting your Site account and your social media account, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.  If you do not want your Personal Information shared with other users or with your social media account provider, please do not connect your social media account with your Site account and do not participate in social sharing on the Sites.<br>
by you, if you participate in a live social media feed (which you may do, for example, by referencing us in your social media post or “liking” us on a social media platform).  If you do participate, your public username and profile photo may be displayed on the Sites along with your post. 
to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).<br>
as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.<br>
